# Step One
In this step your goal is to write a simple version of wc, let's call it ccwc (wc for Coding Challenges) that takes the command line option -c and outputs the number of bytes in a file.

If you've done it right your output should match this:

```plain
>ccwc -c test.txt
  342190 test.txt
```

If it doesn't, check your code, fix any bugs and try again. If it does, congratulations! On to..
